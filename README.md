## About the game

Washed Out is an atmospheric narrative about a day in the life of an introvert. Al is supposed to go out and meet a friend, but the world outside seems daunting and gray. Help Al discover that there is still beauty to be found, even in a colorless town.

This project was developed by students as part of the project 8-Bit of Bauhaus II at the Bauhaus-University Weimar in the period of 6 months. The idea was to develop a small game in order to study the game development process and develop our skills. 

This 2D pixel art game was created using Unity.
